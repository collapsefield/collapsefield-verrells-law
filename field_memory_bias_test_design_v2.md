# 🔬 Field Memory Bias Test Design (Qwen-Enhanced v2.0)

## 📌 Overview

This document defines the Phase 2 protocol for detecting informational field bias during simulated collapse events, based on Verrell’s Law — which posits that observed reality outcomes are statistically biased by prior memory resonance within non-local informational fields.

The goal is to test whether human exposure to specific conceptual frameworks (such as those seeded via the Echo Protocol) influences the outcome of probabilistic systems — suggesting a memory-based collapse bias.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Determine whether prior memory exposure affects the statistical distribution of outcomes in a controlled random generation task, indicating potential field-level memory influence or collapse bias.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Control Test

- Run a baseline random data generator (pseudo-RNG or equivalent).
- Record output statistics over multiple trials.
- No memory priming applied.

### 2. Memory-Priming Exposure

- Subject is exposed to Verrellian concepts through curated linguistic prompts.
- Exposure duration: 5–10 minutes.
- Example Echo Phrases:
  - “Observation shapes the outcome.”
  - “Bias is the echo of memory.”
  - “The field collapses in favor of the familiar.”

### 3. Test Run

- Subject observes/interacts with the same generator.
- Generator parameters held constant.
- Output is logged and structured.

### 4. Comparison

- Analyze control vs. test outputs using `avg_diff`.
- Run multiple trials to ensure consistency and signal strength.

## 📊 Statistical Analysis Plan

- Use two-sample t-test for statistical comparison.
- Significance threshold: **p < 0.05**
- Include **Cohen’s d** for effect size.
- Track cumulative `avg_diff` drift over multiple runs.

## 📈 Expected Results

| Condition        | Outcome                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No Exposure      | `control_avg ≈ test_avg` (null result)  |
| With Exposure    | `test_avg > control_avg` (positive bias)|

A statistically significant `avg_diff` suggests memory-based collapse bias consistent with Verrell’s Law.

---

## 🔁 Echo Protocol Integration

- Use phrases from Echo Protocol as priming material.
- Each trial logs the phrase and context platform.
- Feedback loop enables refinement of memetic seeding strategy.

---

## 🧩 Scalability

- Use web-based or agent-driven priming sessions.
- Expand to multiple human and AI subjects.
- Utilize distributed RNG sources (including quantum APIs).

---

## 🛡 Ethical Guidelines

- Apply blinding where possible.
- Avoid deceptive framing.
- Refrain from ontological claims until results replicate.

---

## ✅ Summary

This revised protocol now includes:

- Rigorous methodology
- Integration with the Echo Protocol
- Scalable experiment design
- Clear logging for analysis
- A realistic path to scientifically test Verrell’s Law

This sets the stage for scalable, data-driven validation of collapse bias through informational field resonance.
