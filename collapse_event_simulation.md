# Collapse Event Simulation

Verrell’s Law suggests that observation does not simply cause quantum or experiential collapse, but *biases* the outcome based on informational resonance — essentially, memory's influence.

## Hypothesis

Reality collapse (quantum or otherwise) is not neutral. It is steered by informational echoes from past experiences embedded in a non-local electromagnetic field.

## Example Simulation

- **Setup**: Controlled environment with observer exposed to emotionally charged memory-priming material.
- **Device**: Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)
- **Expectation**: Output bias correlates with the field resonance state of the observer.

## Measurable Indicator

A statistically significant deviation in QRNG output from expected baseline distribution when observer is "primed."

## Notes

This protocol is foundational to testing the “bias field” component of Verrell’s Law, and future work will integrate EM mapping during such experiments.
