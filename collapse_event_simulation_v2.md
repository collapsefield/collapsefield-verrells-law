# 🧪 Collapse Event Simulation (Verrell's Law – Phase 3 Protocol v2.0)

Verrell’s Law suggests that observation does not simply cause quantum or experiential collapse, but *biases* the outcome based on informational resonance — essentially, memory’s influence within non-local electromagnetic fields.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To test whether memory-primed observers induce statistically significant deviations in quantum random number generator (QRNG) outputs compared to baseline readings.

---

## 🧪 Hypothesis

Reality collapse (quantum or otherwise) is not neutral. It is steered by informational echoes from past experiences embedded in non-local informational fields. Observers exposed to emotionally resonant memory-priming materials will show correlated deviations in QRNG output.

## 🧩 Experimental Setup

### Phase 3 Context

This document outlines Phase 3 of the Verrell’s Law experimental framework, building on prior bias detection via memory priming and memetic seeding (Phases 1–2).

### 1. Observer Priming

- Subjects are shown content (text, images, audio) designed to evoke conceptual familiarity.
- Content includes Echo Protocol seed phrases:
  - “Observation shapes the outcome.”
  - “The field collapses in favor of the familiar.”
- Control group receives neutral, unrelated factual content.

### 2. Device Configuration

- **QRNG Device:** Commercially available (e.g., QRBG.org, ANU QRNG)
- **Output Format:** Binary (0/1) or scaled float (0.0–1.0)
- **Sampling Duration:** 5–10 minutes pre/post priming
- **Logging Format:** JSON with timestamps, session ID, priming type

### 3. Test Procedure

1. Record QRNG output before priming (baseline)
2. Present memory-priming content to observer
3. Record QRNG output after priming
4. Repeat across multiple subjects and sessions

### 4. Log Structure

```json

  "timestamp": "2025-04-06T12:00:00Z",
  "session_id": "CES-2025-001",
  "priming_type": "Verrellian",

  }
}
```

## 📊 Statistical Analysis

- **Binary Output:** Binomial test (expectation = 0.5)
- **Continuous Output:** T-test or Mann-Whitney U
- **Significance Threshold:** p < 0.05
- **Effect Size:** Cohen’s d for deviation strength

---

## 🔗 Protocol Integration

- Builds on Phase 2: Field Memory Bias Test Design
- Integrates Echo Protocol phrases into priming procedure
- Shared log structure for unified analysis
- Enables cross-validation between linguistic seeding and statistical collapse bias

---

## 🧬 Future Directions

- Incorporate EEG/MEG monitoring to detect gamma entrainment during priming
- Track neural signatures and correlate with QRNG deviations
- Test multi-subject synchronization and collective collapse effects

---

## 🛡 Ethical Considerations

- Informed consent required
- Avoid framing results as deterministic reality manipulation
- Interpret trends cautiously: correlation ≠ control
- Use ideologically neutral priming material

---

## ✅ Summary

This Phase 3 protocol provides:

- A clear, measurable framework to test Verrell’s Law
- Integration with prior Echo and Field Bias protocols
- Logging and statistical tools for experimental validation
- Setup for future integration with brain activity mapping

Verrell’s Law moves from concept to collapse in measurable form. Next: build, observe, and log the bias.
