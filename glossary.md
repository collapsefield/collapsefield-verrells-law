# Glossary of Core Concepts

**Collapse Bias**  
The tendency of a probabilistic system to resolve based on prior informational resonance, not purely chance.

**Gamma Entrainment**  
Modulation of brainwave activity to align with specific memory access frequencies (30â€“100Hz).

**Field Memory**  
Non-local information structures that persist beyond neural encoding, accessible via EM resonance.

**CRI (Consciousness-Reality Interface)**  
The boundary layer where observer states influence or bias the unfolding of physical or perceived reality.

**Resonance Signature**  
A stable, measurable EM frequency pattern unique to each consciousness. Identifiable via EEG/MEG.
