# Field Memory Bias Test Design (Verrell’s Law Phase 2 Protocol)

## Overview

This experiment is designed to test a core hypothesis of Verrell’s Law: that memory does not reside in the brain alone, but influences probabilistic outcomes through a resonance-based bias field. The brain functions as a tuner, accessing external informational strata encoded within electromagnetic fields. When memory is primed prior to observation, the resulting collapse (simulated via pseudorandom output) is expected to show measurable bias.

---

## Hypothesis

> Prior memory priming will statistically bias the outcome of random data generation, resulting in a significant deviation from control conditions.

---

## Objective

To determine whether observers exposed to standardized memory priming cause statistically significant shifts in the output of a random data generator.

---

## Experimental Design

### Groups

- **Control Group**: No memory priming exposure.
- **Test Group**: Subjects exposed to standardized memory priming prior to each run.

### Sample Size

- Minimum 20 runs per group (ideally 50+)
- At least 5 individual subjects per group for between- and within-subject analysis

### Memory Priming Protocol

- Use emotionally resonant stimuli (images, sounds, phrases) selected based on prior EEG literature
- Each priming session lasts 2 minutes prior to test run
- Same stimuli used across all subjects to maintain consistency

---

## Random Data Generation

- Simulated quantum collapse: pseudorandom number generator (Python `random` or QRNG API)
- Each run generates a binary sequence (e.g., 1000 bits)
- Result converted into an average (e.g., 0.493)

```

## Statistical Analysis Plan

- **Primary metric**: `avg_diff` between control and primed runs
- **Test used**: Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (if data non-parametric)
- **Significance level**: `p < 0.05`
- **Confidence Interval**: 95%

---

## Controlling Confounds

- All subjects tested in same environmental conditions (light, noise, time of day)
- Priming materials standardized across sessions
- Equipment calibration confirmed pre-test
- Order of runs randomized to avoid order effects

---

## Expected Results

### Outcome Scenarios

- **Positive avg_diff (significant)**: Field bias present, memory resonance supported
- **Null result**: No observable bias, needs reevaluation of priming strength or protocol
- **Negative avg_diff**: Possible inverse field effect or repulsion, requires follow-up

---

## Next Steps

If results indicate bias, follow-up experiments will include:

- Varying priming types (e.g., emotionally neutral vs personal memory triggers)
- Repeating test with true QRNG devices
- EEG monitoring during priming and collapse stages
